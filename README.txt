1. INTRODUCTION
The code in this repository uses PhysioNet's GrabMyo 1.0.2 dataset 
for feature extraction and building and training machine learning 
models for general prediction of hand movements/gestures.

2. DATASET STRUCTURE
The dataset used in this code is the PhysioNet GrabMyo 1.0.2 dataset 
which provides EMG signals recordings of 43 participants over 3 
different days while performing multiple hand gestures. The signals 
have been acquired at a sampling rate of 2048 Hz using the EMGUSB2+ 
device (OT Bioelletronica, Italy). EMG signals have been collected 
from 16 locations (channels) on the forearm and 12 locations on the wrist.
